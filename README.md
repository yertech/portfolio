# Yertech.org Portfolio (Gatsby.js + Netlify + Cosmic.js + Theme)

Yertech Portfolio created with :

- Gatsby.js : gatsby-portfolio starter
- Cosmic.js : headless cms. Get all content with GraphQL API
- Netlify : Add CI/CD and hosting with custom CDN.
  Hooks for build and deploy on every push on master branch, and one hook for every update on Cosmic.js
- Theme : [Kenedy by Corlolib](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/kenedy/). I kept only html and css and I removed all js (jquery,etc) to adapt animations with react components and libraries

Edit for test : Replaced temporary Cosmic.js by local static json files
